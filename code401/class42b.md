### Ethics in the workplace

- Article: [The ethical dilemmas of self-driving cars](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/technology/the-ethical-dilemmas-of-self-drivingcars/article37803470/)

- Reading this article was definitely interesting and eye-opening. I do agree that there is a 'scary' side of AI cars when it comes to situations where all senarios lead to losing human lives, but I, myself have to be on the side of having and developing more AI cars to eventually paint a future where all cars are smart. Because in such dilemmas people often forget that the outcome compared to a human-driving car would lead to more severe damage, just looking at the reaction times it takes a human comapred to ZERO in AI cars says a lot.

### Ethics in Technology

- Article: [The employee backlash over Googleâ€™s censored search engine for China, explained](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/17/17704526/google-dragonfly-censored-search-engine-china)

- Reading this article was shocking honestly, DragonFly is clearly a human-rights violation of freedom of speech and freedom of access to information. I am strongly against this project, it is 'wrong' in my opinions on all levels, to be more clear Censorship in all its forms is unethical, you can't stop anyone from information, it'll be reached in many other black market options; On the other hand if you want to educate on a certain subject to guid them to understand your point of view against another that's way more acceptable.
