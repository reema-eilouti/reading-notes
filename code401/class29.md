## Django Custom User

- There are two modern ways to create a custom user model in Django: `AbstractUser` and `AbstractBaseUser`. 

- In both cases we can subclass them to extend existing functionality however AbstractBaseUser requires much more work. 

- **Note**: we did not run migrate to configure our database. It's important to wait until after we've created our new custom user model before doing so.


### Custom User Model

- Creating our initial custom user model requires four steps:

   1. update `settings.py`.
        - add the accounts app and use the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` config to tell Django to use our new custom user model in place of the built-in User model, within `INSTALLED_APPS` add accounts at the bottom, then at the bottom of the entire file, add the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` config.

   2. create a new `CustomUser` model.

   3. create new `UserCreation` and `UserChangeForm`.

   4. update the admin.
   

## DjangoX

- **DjangoX**, is an open-source Django starter framework that includes a custom user model, "email/password" by default instead of "username/email/password", social authentication, and more.

- DjangoX can be installed via Pip, Pipenv, or Docker depending upon your setup. To start, clone the repo to your local computer and change into the proper directory.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/wsvincent/djangox.git
$ cd djangox
```

- pip

```
$ python3 -m venv djangox
$ source djangox/bin/activate
(djangox) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(djangox) $ python manage.py migrate
(djangox) $ python manage.py createsuperuser
(djangox) $ python manage.py runserver
